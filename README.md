# Band-Website
During my first year I was required to develop a web application that showcased my ability to create basic web pages using HTML to mark-up content, control its presentation using CSS and write efficient and readable client-side scripts that are event and object-driven. It also had to run on multiple browsers and apply web design usability principles in its design.
